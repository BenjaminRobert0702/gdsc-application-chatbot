**FULL NAME:**
Benjamin Robert

**UNIVERSITY & MAJOR:**
I am a final-year student at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology (SIST), Chennai, pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE).

**MY PASSION FOR TECHNOLOGY:**
My journey into technology began with curiosity about how systems, both hardware and software, can make everyday life smarter. As an ECE student, I started with circuits and VLSI but developed a strong interest in coding, AI/ML, and full-stack web development. I love projects that combine hardware principles with software innovation. My VLSI research taught me about micro-level efficiency, while my ride-sharing app project (RideRay) taught me about large-scale system design and user experience. What excites me most is creating solutions that directly impact peopleâ€™s lives.

**WHY I AM A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR LEADERSHIP:**
I believe leadership is about enabling others to grow and empowering communities.
1.  **I am a good listener:** I break down complex tech concepts into simple explanations to encourage people to ask questions without fear.
2.  **I am a proactive organizer:** As the Management Lead of Hack S.I.S.T., our universityâ€™s tech club, I have coordinated hackathons, workshops, and collaboration efforts with students and faculty.
3.  **I am passionate about Google & modern technologies:** Iâ€™ve explored tools like Firebase, Flutter, Google Cloud, and Maps APIs. My curiosity drives me to not only learn but also teach others.

**MY VISION & ACTION PLAN FOR STUDENT COMMUNITIES:**
-   **Code School Series:** Consistent, beginner-friendly workshops on one technology per month (Python, Web Dev, ML intro).
-   **Build-a-Thon Weekends:** Non-competitive collaborative events for teams to build prototypes with mentorship.
-   **Tech Talks & Tea:** Relaxed monthly conversations with industry professionals and alumni.
-   **Bridging Juniors & Seniors:** Creating an open channel for first- and second-years to connect with senior mentors.

**MY PROJECTS:**
-   **RideRay â€” Campus Ride-Sharing App:** A real-time ride-sharing platform for students.
    -   **Tech Stack:** Vue.js, TailwindCSS, Google Maps, Laravel, Sanctum, and Pusher (WebSockets).
    -   **Features:** Rider/driver matching, live trip tracking, estimated fares, and a glassmorphism UI.
-   **High-Speed Area-Efficient Adder Architecture (ECE Final-Year Project):**
    -   Designed a 32-bit Kogge-Stone Parallel Prefix Adder using Pass Transistor Logic (PTL) for high speed and area efficiency.
    -   Implemented using Cadence ASIC design flow with RTL, synthesis, and simulation.
-   **Portfolio Website:** Built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-   **Mini AI/ML Projects:** Applied Python libraries for classification and prediction experiments.
-   **Club & Event Projects:** As Management Lead of Hack S.I.S.T., I planned and executed coding contests and workshops.

**MY TECHNICAL SKILLS:**
-   **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, C, Dart
-   **Frameworks & Tools:** Vue.js, Laravel, Flutter, Firebase, Google Cloud, Git & GitHub, TailwindCSS, Cadence ASIC Design Flow
-   **Concepts:** VLSI Design, AI/ML Fundamentals, Full-Stack Development, Real-time Web Apps
-   **Soft Skills:** Public Speaking, Team Leadership, Event & Club Management, Community Building, Mentoring

**HIGHLIGHTS & ACHIEVEMENTS:**
-   **Leadership:** Management Lead at Hack S.I.S.T.
-   **Innovation:** Built RideRay, a full-stack real-time ride-sharing app.
-   **Research:** Final-year VLSI project on advanced adder architectures.
-   **Career Prep:** Actively preparing for the Virtusa 2025 campus drive.

**MY VISION FOR THE FUTURE:**
I see myself as a bridge between electronics and computer science. My ECE background provides a strong foundation in hardware, while my passion for AI/ML and web development drives software innovation. I aim to build impactful products, grow as a developer and mentor, and eventually lead technological initiatives that solve meaningful problems.
